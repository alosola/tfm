# Instructions for running the code
The Jupyter notebooks contain the plots and working code, but once a step is complete the
processing is extracted to a separate file. These generate objects which are needed by
the following files. They should be run in this order:
1. init_data.py
2. calibration.py


# Git usage notes
Large data files are stored with git LFS.
Jupyter notebooks are stored without output cells.

Images are saved to "generated" folder, but not all images should be uploaded to git...
